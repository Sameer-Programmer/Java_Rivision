# üìò Java Class Naming and Compilation Rules

## üîπ Class Name and Filename Rules

- If there is **no access modifier** (like `public`) for the class name,  
  üëâ the **filename and class name can be different**. No problem.

- If the class is declared with the **`public` access modifier**,  
  üëâ then the **filename must be the same as the class name**.
