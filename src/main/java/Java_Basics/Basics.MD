# üîÅ Java Program Execution Flow

1. We write code in a source file with a `.java` extension.
2. The compiler converts the source code into **bytecode**.
3. The source file is compiled into a `.class` file (bytecode).
4. The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** executes the bytecode.
5. There is a compiler called **JIT (Just-In-Time)**, which is responsible for converting the bytecode into **machine-native code**, so that the JVM can execute it more efficiently.
